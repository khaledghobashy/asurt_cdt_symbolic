Please visit `uraeus.mbd <https://github.com/khaledghobashy/uraeus_mbd>`_ for more information about **audience** , **fields of applications** and **background**.

----

Features
--------
- Creation of symbolic **template-based** and **standalone** multi-body systems using minimal API via python scripting.
- Convenient and easy creation of complex multi-body assemblies.
- Convenient visualization of the system topology as a network graph.
- Viewing the system's symbolic equations in a natural mathematical format using Latex printing.
- Optimization of the system symbolic equations by performing common sub-expressions elimination.
- Creation of symbolic configuration files to facilitate the process of numerical simulation data entry.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation is hosted at readthedocs and can be found `here <https://uraeus-smbd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. 

.. note:: The documentation is still under construction!


Installation
------------
The package needs a valid python 3.6+ environment. If new to scientific computing in python, 
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ is a recommended free python distribution from Continuum 
Analytics that includes SymPy, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more useful packages for scientific computing, 
which provides a nice coherent platform with most of the tools needed.

Git
'''
As the package is still under continuous development, cloning this repository is a more versatile way to test and
play with it, until a more stable first release is released. 
This can be done via the following **git** command using the terminal (Linux and Mac) or powershell (Windows).

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/khaledghobashy/uraeus_smbd.git

This will download the repository locally on your machine. To install the package locally and use it as other
python packages, using the same terminal/powershell run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e uraeus_smbd
