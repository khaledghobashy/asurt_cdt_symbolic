Installation
============
The package needs a valid python 3.6+ environment. If new to scientific computing in python, 
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ is a recommended free python distribution from 
Continuum Analytics that includes SymPy, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more useful packages for 
scientific computing, which provides a nice coherent platform with most of the tools needed.

Pip
---
.. code:: bash

    pip install uraeus.smbd


Git
---
As the package is still under continuous development, cloning this repository is a more versatile way 
to test and play with it, until a more stable first release is released. 
This can be done via the following **git** command using the terminal (Linux and Mac) or powershell 
(Windows).

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/khaledghobashy/uraeus_smbd.git

This will download the repository locally on your machine. To install the package locally and use it 
as other python packages, using the same terminal/powershell run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e uraeus_smbd
