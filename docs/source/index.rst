Multi-Body Systems
------------------
In modern literature, multi-body systems refer to modern mechanical systems that are often very complex
and consist of many components interconnected by joints and force elements such as springs, dampers, and 
actuators. Examples of multi-body systems are machines, mechanisms, robotics, vehicles, space structures, 
and bio-mechanical systems. The dynamics of such systems are often governed by complex relationships 
resulting from the relative motion and joint forces between the components of the system. [1]

Therefore, a multi-body system is hereby defined as *a finite number of material bodies connected in an 
arbitrary fashion by mechanical joints that limit the relative motion between pairs of bodies*.
Practitioners of multi-body dynamics study the generation and solution of the equations governing the 
motion of such systems [2].
